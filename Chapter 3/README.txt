Testing with F# - Chapter 3
---------------------------

This is the code bundle for testing with F# chapter 3. Dependencies to the project will be
downloaded at first compilation.

This can be built outside Visual Studio by executing the build.bat script from Deverloper
Command Prompt for VS2013. This can be found in your Start Menu searching for Visual Studio Tools.
