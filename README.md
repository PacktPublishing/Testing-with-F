# Testing with F#

This is the code bundle for Testing with F#. All examples here where created with Visual Studio 2013 and F# 4.3.1.
They are also verified to work with Visual Studio Community Edition.

You should have a development machine where you can run the latest version of Windows with an installation of Visual Studio Community 2013.
The Visual Studio Community 2013 edition is a fully featured IDE that contains
everything you need in order to run the examples in this book and get started
with F# development. You can download it from Microsoft at http://www.

There is an even better test runner provided by JetBrains Resharper that will increase productivity when running test-driven development.
